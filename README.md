# Java Foundations 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning **Java from first principles**, with a strong focus on **clarity, correctness, and long-term understanding** rather than rushing through syntax.

The goal of this repo is to build a **solid Java foundation** that makes **DSA, backend development, and Spring Boot** feel natural later on.

---

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy

- Learn concepts **slowly and properly**
- Use **small sandbox programs** (one concept per file)
- Avoid overengineering
- Prefer understanding *why* something exists, not just *how*
- Write code as notes instead of maintaining separate notes

This repo is intentionally **not** a production project — it’s a learning lab.

🟦 Phase 1 — Java Basics
- Variables & data types
- Input / Output (Scanner)
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Methods
- Arrays
- Strings
- Exceptions (try / catch)

Each file focuses on one concept only, using simple examples.

🟦 Phase 2 — Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors
- this keyword
- Encapsulation (private, getters/setters)
- static members
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Interfaces & Abstract Classes
- Object lifecycle (creation, references, GC — conceptual)

The goal here is recognition and comfort, not mastery.

🟦 Phase 3 — Java Collections
- ArrayList
- HashMap
- HashSet
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque

The goal here is to make things simpler when starting DSA.

🧠 Notes
- This repo is updated gradually, not all at once
- Commits reflect learning progress, not milestones
- Code prioritizes readability over cleverness

📌 Why this repo exists

This repository exists so that:
- Java never becomes a bottleneck later
- DSA focuses on thinking, not syntax
- Backend frameworks feel structured instead of overwhelming
